#to add sending event data for the widget:
    https://help.cloud.just-ai.com/en/jaicp/channels/chatwidget/event_based_sending#text-message
#to add $reactions.timeout
    timeout - This method sets an automatic transition to another state if there is no input from the user 
    in the specified time
#add .yaml file with configurations (for gitlab dependencies, $injector global variables etc.)
#init: tag in the beginning of the scenarios, to execute postProcess and preProccess functions
#add $chatHistory string in the format:
    CLIENT
    [User input/request]

    BOT
    [First bot reply]
    [Second bot reply]

    CLIENT
    [User input/request]
#to $context or $request to add:
    -timestamp 
    -the chatId (probably from my chat-operator)
    -response (this is the bot response) - response.replies - which will have an object with
        {
            type: "text", 
            text: "the bot's response",
            currentState: "/Current/State"
        }
    -contextHistory - this will be the previous state that the user was in and the user input:
        {
            previousState: "/Previous/State",
            userInput: $input #can use the $input here probably?
        }

ADDED: $reactions.answer
ADDED: $reactions.buttons
ADDED: $reactions.transition  

FIXED: (TO IMPROVE WITH $regex tag in q tags)
#global q! tag doesnt work. it doesnt transition to that state


WHEN FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT STARTS!:
#write HTML tags in the "a:" tags
FIXED:
#$input object stays the same when inputting different information throughout states (it assigns only the
first time, then)
FIXED:
    #check if its possible to leave comments with // in the script tags and # in the rest of the .bot files
FIXED:
    #debug why the go! in Start doesnt transition instantly to the next state the 2nd time it goes around
FIXED:
    #multiple "a:" tags - only the last one is displayed.Same for the script tags. I can have at the beginning
    #of the state or at the end (before a: and after a:) and both script tags should be executed 
#PARTIALLY FIXED:
#highlight syntax in .bot files
    Open Command Palette → Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)
    or press Ctrl + Shift + P, then type that.
    Add this line inside your settings object:
    "files.associations": {
        "*.bot": "yaml"
    }
    TO BE CONSIDERED for highlight syntax: 
    Would you like me to generate a small .tmLanguage.json syntax definition next?
    That would give your .bot files native highlighting (e.g., state: and a: in distinct colors, 
    ${} syntax colored like JS, etc.), not just YAML-based coloring.
