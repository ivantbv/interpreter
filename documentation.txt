-лучше добавлять ; в конце выражениях в тэге script
-можно писать джаваскрипт выражения в тэгах "a:" через ${}, например ${addTwo(5, 3)}
-можно писать JS выражения в $reactions.buttons через `${}` 

$reactions.answer("Message text"); - simple usage. In the text response, i 
can also use substitutions inside the ${} which can contain any valid JavaScript expression, like so: 
$reactions.answer(Hello, {{ $client.name }}!);
 Also the possibility to write HTML inside it like in the regular "a:" tag (but thats for when I 
 start with the frontend integration) Next is the $reactions.buttons these are all valid ways to 
 write it: $reactions.buttons({ text: "Transition button", // Required transition: "/state" }) - 
 this button is equal to a button in a tag "buttons:" that has a state to transition to. 
 $reactions.buttons("One button") - this is a single button, its equal to a button in a tag 
 "buttons:" that doesnt specify a state to transition to (just input in the chat) 
 $reactions.buttons(["One button", "And another one"]) - I can also add multiple buttons without a 
 state to transition to in an array. This should also be a valid button Now the 
 $reactions.transition $reactions.transition( {value: "/Welcome", deferred: false} ); - 
 it takes 2 arguments - value and deferred. value is the state path that you can transition to 
 when clicking that button. The path after can be both absolute and relative 
 (like in the usual transitions we have already) / — root topic; . — current state; .. — state from a 
 higher level (parent state); ./.. — separation of path elements. The deferred flag is a boolean. 
 The function with the deferred transition flag deferred=true is equivalent to the "go:" tag. The 
 function with the deferred flag deferred=false is equivalent to the "go!:" tag. 
 $reactions.transition("/Welcome"); -this is also a valid call with just the state path, in this case 
 the transition is with a deferred=false
